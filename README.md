# introAPPiOS

IntroApp is a dating app I made in Flutter.

The USP (unique selling point) of Intro is that you each get 6 messages each, once those 12 messages are up it is time to meet or not to meet this person.

The idea being that spending long amounts of time messaging someone over a dating app is futile it is instead better meeting people face-to-face and deciding then and there if you like the person or not. Your time is valuable. If someone isn't dying to spend time with you why would you want to spend time with them.
